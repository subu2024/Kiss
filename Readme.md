Get Started
-----------

- download files from github
- create a folder
- create additional folders for content, output. Within content folder, create pages and blog folder.
- update config.json with updated folder names (if required)
- update config.json with google analytics id, if required
- create content and drop into content/blog folder
- run the main.py to create a html output in the output folder
- that's all.. you are good to go..

Code
-----------

- bloggerEngine.py .. this is the heart of this application. Does the heavy lifting 
- configParser.py .. this piece of code reads the config.json file. config provides ample customization. see below for details
- myDatabase.py .. simple code to read .md files
- main.py .. this is the main program   

The data is combined into a large JSON file that the jinja parser can use to fill in the templates
- more details TBD

AWS
----------

- if AWS is the chosen option, then provide the API in the config file
- Lambda and API Gateway is used for "claps" count 
- The lambda receives 
{title_str: title of the post}
and returns with
{title_str: title of the post,
clap_int: count of total claps}
- within the lambda function, the following functionality happens
- search for a record with the title. if found, get the count and add 1 to it. if not found, insert the title and count of 1 .. response is sent back with the title and updated count
